      <h3>Audience Perception of Realism</h3>
      <p>
        CGI has significantly changed how viewers see realism in visual media.
        In the past, when CGI was still developing, people could easily spot its
        flaws; the graphics often looked fake or unconvincing because of the
        limited technology available at the time. However, as CGI advanced, it
        achieved such high levels of photorealism that it can now make it hard
        to tell what's real and what's not. This improvement in CGI has shifted
        what audiences expect regarding realism in movies, TV shows, and video
        games (Louis, 2014).
      </p>
      <p>
        One major change in how audiences view CGI is its ability to create
        incredibly realistic environments, objects, and even human characters.
        This idea is often referred to as the “uncanny valley,” which shows how
        viewers can feel both intrigued and uneasy about CGI characters that are
        almost human but not quite there. This effect is especially noticeable
        in movies that use hyper-realistic CGI for human figures, like The Polar
        Express or Beowulf, where the almost lifelike faces and movements can
        lead to mixed feelings among the audience. The uncanny valley effect
        highlights the tricky balance between realism and believability that CGI
        needs to strike to keep viewers engaged (Louis, 2014).
      </p>
      <h3>Creativity and Artistic Freedom</h3>
      <p>
        CGI has opened amazing opportunities for creativity and artistic
        expression in visual media. It enables creators to turn their wildest
        ideas into reality without the constraints that come with traditional
        filmmaking. Thanks to CGI, filmmakers, game designers, and animators can
        dream up and design entire worlds, unique creatures, and stunning
        effects that would be too difficult or expensive to create in real life.
        This newfound freedom has expanded the range of stories that can be told
        and the ways they can be visually portrayed.
      </p>

      <p>
        Anime has also gained a lot from the freedom that CGI provides.
        Recently, animation studios have started using CGI to produce complex
        action sequences, detailed character designs, and rich backgrounds that
        would take a lot of time to create with just hand-drawn methods. A great
        example is Demon Slayer, which uses CGI to enhance its colorful and
        energetic fight scenes, mixing traditional animation with digital
        techniques to make the visuals even more impressive. This method gives
        anime creators the chance to introduce new ideas and styles to the
        genre, reaching a level of excitement and detail that was hard to
        achieve before (Louis, 2014).
