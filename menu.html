      <h3>Early Development</h3>
      <p>
        The origins of computer-generated imagery (CGI) can be traced back to
        the 1970s and early 1980s, a period marked by advancements in digital
        imaging and computer graphics that laid the foundation for modern
        applications. At first, CGI was largely limited to simple wireframe
        models and low-resolution animations, restricted by the era's processing
        power and software technology (Das, 2023) However, several innovative
        projects showcased the potential of CGI. A notable example is the film
        Tron (1982), which was among the first to incorporate computer graphics
        into mainstream cinema, demonstrating how CGI could create new visual
        experiences that departed from traditional filmmaking techniques. The
        CGI used in Tron was groundbreaking, even though it was still in its
        early stages, as it revealed the possibilities of crafting
        computer-generated environments and visuals that exceeded the
        capabilities of practical effects.
      </p>
      <p>
        The release of Jurassic Park in 1993 represented a critical moment in
        the evolution of CGI within the film industry. Steven Spielberg's
        innovative application of CGI to render realistic dinosaurs transformed
        filmmaking, demonstrating that CGI could serve not merely as a gimmick
        but as an essential narrative device that enhances realism and engages
        viewers in unprecedented manners. Jurassic Park established a benchmark
        for the realistic simulation of living creatures and environments,
        offering a model for numerous films and sectors to emulate (Pearson,
        2023).
      </p>
      <h3>Technological Milestones</h3>
      <p>
        In the following decades, CGI technology experienced significant
        advancements, marked by innovations that greatly enhanced its realism,
        versatility, and user-friendliness. Notable achievements included the
        creation of 3D modeling and rendering software, which empowered creators
        to construct intricate digital models and replicate realistic textures,
        lighting, and shading. Programs such as Autodesk 3ds Max and Maya
        provided artists with the tools to produce detailed, lifelike visuals
        that could compete with the quality of traditional film (Amba, 2023).
      </p>
      <p>
        Motion capture is a game-changing technology that has enabled CGI to
        accurately portray the details of human movement and emotions. This
        innovation has played a crucial role in crafting lifelike and expressive
        CGI characters, exemplified by Gollum in The Lord of the Rings trilogy.
        Andy Serkis's performance brought Gollum to life, showcasing how far CGI
        can go in expressing complex feelings. As technology continues to
        evolve, CGI gets even better at replicating real life, helping creators
        build immersive worlds and characters that seem genuine and believable
        (Adobe, 2024).
      </p>
      <h3>Modern-Day CGI</h3>
      <p>
        CGI has become a crucial part of visual media today, deeply integrated
        into movies, television, video games, and advertising. What used to be
        groundbreaking has transformed into a vital resource that opens endless
        creative opportunities. With the latest developments in artificial
        intelligence and machine learning, CGI has improved even more, making it
        easier for artists to create incredibly realistic images in a shorter
        amount of time. Now, CGI can also work alongside augmented and virtual
        reality, producing engaging experiences that mix the digital and real
        worlds (Das, 2023).
      </p>
      <p>
        In today's media, CGI has become so advanced that viewers might not even
        notice they're seeing computer-generated images. Whether it's complete
        landscapes or actors who look younger thanks to digital effects, CGI has
        achieved such a realistic quality that it can make it hard to tell
        what's real and what's not. The widespread use of CGI has changed what
        audiences expect in terms of visual quality and has also expanded the
        creative possibilities for filmmakers, game developers, and advertisers,
        allowing them to realize their most daring concepts without being
        limited by the physical world (Das, 2023)
      </p>
      <h3>Transformation in Media Formats</h3>
      <p>
        The introduction of CGI has profoundly transformed not just individual
        films and video games but has also redefined entire media formats and
        the ways in which audiences interact with them. In the beginning, CGI
        was mainly utilized in blockbuster films due to its high costs and
        technological requirements, which limited its broader application.
        However, as technology progressed, CGI began to permeate other media
        formats, including television, video games, and anime, significantly
        expanding the reach and influence of computer-generated content across
        various platforms (Adobe, 2024).
      </p>
      <p>
        CGI has revolutionized television by enabling the production of stunning
        visuals even with limited time and money. This change opened the door
        for fantasy and sci-fi shows like Game of Thrones to vividly portray
        intricate imaginary worlds that would have been unfeasible with
        traditional TV budgets (Morrison, 2021). Consequently, we are now
        experiencing a golden age of visually impressive television that
        competes with high-budget movies, altering what viewers expect in terms
        of visual quality across various media (Adobe, 2024).
      </p>
      <p>
        Anime, which is usually recognized for its hand-drawn style, has started
        to use CGI to enhance its visual range and make production easier. In
        the past, CGI in anime often looked limited and stood out in a way that
        some viewers found distracting. However, with recent improvements in CGI
        technology, anime studios have been able to mix CGI with traditional
        animation more effectively, resulting in exciting scenes that would be
        tough to create by hand. Series like Land of the Lustrous and Beastars
        showcase how CGI can be used to create smooth, detailed animations and
        complex camera movements that add a unique touch to storytelling.
