        How has CGI transformed visual in media and altered audience perception
        of realism and creativity?
      </h2>
      <h3>Introduction</h3>
      <p>
        Computer-Generated Imagery, or CGI, is all about making visual content
        using digital technology. It's widely used in movies, video games, ads,
        and various other media like anime. In the beginning, CGI was basic,
        with simple graphics like wireframes and straightforward animations,
        mostly because of the limited tech available back then. But over the
        years, CGI has changed a lot, evolving from flat images to incredibly
        realistic environments that look just like the real world. This
        development has made CGI an essential part of the entertainment
        industry, as well as in advertising and virtual experiences, allowing
        creators to showcase detailed and vibrant scenes that really expand what
        we can see visually.
