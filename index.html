        How has CGI transformed visual in media and altered audience perception
        of realism and creativity?
      </h2>
      <h3>Introduction</h3>
      <p>
        Computer-Generated Imagery, or CGI, is all about making visual content
        using digital technology. It's widely used in movies, video games, ads,
        and various other media like anime. In the beginning, CGI was basic,
        with simple graphics like wireframes and straightforward animations,
        mostly because of the limited tech available back then. But over the
        years, CGI has changed a lot, evolving from flat images to incredibly
        realistic environments that look just like the real world. This
        development has made CGI an essential part of the entertainment
        industry, as well as in advertising and virtual experiences, allowing
        creators to showcase detailed and vibrant scenes that really expand what
        we can see visually.

      <h3>Purpose of the Review</h3>
      <p>
        CGI has come a long way since its beginning in iconic movies Jurassic
        Park (Pearson,2023). It has evolved into a major player in the visual
        media world, changing from a suitable skill into something crucial.
        Nowadays, CGI is vital for defining how we see modern mediaâ€”whether it
        is adding digital effects to live-action films, crafting entire animated
        environments, or making augmented reality experiences. The ongoing
        advancements in CGI tech allow for stunningly realistic visuals that can
        evoke strong emotions and tell intricate stories, reshaping what
        audiences expect globally.

      <h3>Statement</h3>
      <p>
        CGI has significantly changed modern media in two main ways: it has made
        visuals more realistic than ever before and has also opened new path for
        creativity. This technology allows creators to produce stunning images
        that were previously unimaginable. In this review, we will explore how
        these two effects have transformed visual media, with CGI raising the
        bar for what audiences expect in terms of realism and expanding the
        creative options for artists and storytellers.
